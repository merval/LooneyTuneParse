# LooneyTunesParse
Some years ago I was given about 50 DVD's that were copies of various Looney Tunes DVD. I wanted to get them ripped and added to my Media Collection, problem was, the discs contained episodes from various seasons and were all labeled as "Golden Collection" or "Spotlight Collection".. The actual episode names remained the same.

Having the episode name remain the same was a big deal, I could use that to cross reference a CSV that contained all of the episodes titles and what Season and Episode they were.
